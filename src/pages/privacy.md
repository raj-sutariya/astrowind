Patent Assist is committed to safeguarding your privacy. This privacy policy outlines how we collect and utilize information from our users.
We value your trust and ensure that your information is used only as specified herein.

## The Information We Collect

We collect information primarily through the Patent Assist website. This may include your name, billing details, email address, and employer
name. We do not retain payment information; instead, we rely on PhonePe for secure payment processing.

We also collect information pertaining to your interactions with our
website and your engagement with hosted services. This encompasses
activities on Patent Assist products, standard website server log
information (IP address, etc.), visited pages, actions performed,
engagement with our newsletters and social media content, and
demographic data.

In addition, we may source information from publicly available
outlets, such as publicly accessible patent data and other
publicly available profile and intellectual property resources.

During the course of handling confidential invention/ patent-associated documentation,
including patent applications accompanied by invention disclosure, provisional patent, complete specification
reports and other finalized patent drafts, we undertake this process in a transitory
capacity. The substantive content of your invention/patent-related documents or
finalized drafts derived from AI generation using our isolated models, and further
proofreading, modifying and ommiting in our editor is only maintained temporarily and not
stored indefinitely. Once the user chooses to delete the data, it is deleted from everywhere beyond recovery. We
might, however, generate statistical data concerning time spent on proofreading
AI generated content, such as quantifiable instances of editions, ommisions and additions detected within
patent documents.

Moreover, we assure that all the Patent Drafts (both provisional and complete) and Invention
Disclosure Forms (Including PDF, Invention Images etc.) are securely stored within our
cloud based systems on Azure Servers. We routinely perform
assessments of our data pipelines to identify and mitigate any
potential instances of data leakage either into or out of our systems.
These forms remain confidential and are not divulged to any external
party. Such information is exclusively preserved for the internal
purpose of processing and preparing outputs using the AI model.

## Use of Collected Information

The information we gather serves a variety of purposes for our
business operations, including:

- Providing services to you
- Facilitating billing processes
- Enhancing comprehension of user interactions with our services
- Improving and optimizing our services
- Providing customer support
- Distributing newsletters
- Enhancing sales and marketing initiatives
- Conducting advertising activities

We may acknowledge your company as a PatentAssist.ai customer unless you
opt out by contacting us directly.

of these cookies for the purpose of maintaining your session and

We enlist the services of reputable third-party entities that
prioritize personal information protection. Information may be shared
with these third-party providers as required for the functions
delineated in this policy. Some examples of such services include
PhonePe, Google (G Suite, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and
Google Optimize), LinkedIn.

In compliance with legal obligations or the enforcement of our terms
of service, we might share your personal information.

However, the content of your invention disclosures, patent documents or finalized drafts
can only be accessed by you, using your login credentials and
will not be shared with any third parties, except for processing purposes in a transitory capacity
on Microsoft Azure. Furthermore, all data gathered for processing intentions will
exclusively be stored within data server centers located in India. For
further details about their policies, please refer to [Microsoft Azureâ€™s trusted cloud privacy note](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/trusted-cloud/privacy#:~:text=With%20Azure%2C%20you%20are%20the,like%20marketing%20research%20or%20advertising.).

The information contained within your patent documents, specifically
the data contained in the Invention disclosure form and selected
sections of the composed complete specification report, will be
transmitted to "Isolated AI Models" which are hosted securely on Azure for processing purposes. However, it is
important to note that this data will not be utilized to train any
models, either yours or others, in the course of employing the processing API.
For additional details, please consult the API data privacy page
provided by [Azure API service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy).

Beyond the aforementioned services, in rare and unintentional cases where our website directs
you to external websites or services which are not aforementioned, we wish to emphasize that we
bear no responsibility for data protection measures pertaining to
those external services.

We use only publicly avaiable data exclusively for the purpose of training our own
proprietary AI model. This model focuses on analyzing publicly
available patent documents that have been published or granted only.
Our training processes do not involve the storage or utilization of
proprietary, confidential, or undisclosed patent information.

By availing our services, you acknowledge your understanding of the
privacy policy and provide your consent to its terms. Should the
existing privacy policy prove unsatisfactory in any manner, kindly reach out to us via email to initiate a request for a revision of the
said policy. Please feel free to contact us with any inquiries or
concerns about your data usage or our privacy practices. We value your
privacy and are dedicated to maintaining the security of your
information.
