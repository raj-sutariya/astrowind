At [PatentAssist.ai](http://patentassist.ai/), we are dedicated to providing high-quality service and support to our customers. We value your trust in selecting our software for your business needs. Our refund policy is structured to ensure clarity and satisfaction with your purchase decisions.

## Monthly Subscriptions

Please note that all monthly subscriptions are non-refundable. We encourage our customers to evaluate their needs carefully before purchasing a monthly subscription.

## Annual Subscriptions

For annual subscriptions, we offer a refund if you decide to cancel your subscription within the first 45 days of purchase. To process a cancellation and receive a refund, you must inform us at least 45 days prior to the subscription end date. This allows us to accommodate your request effectively and ensures that you are not charged for an additional year. So if you cancel before 15th of current month, you be charged for this month and next month but not after. You will recieve the balance for the year via decided channels.

## No Automatic Renewals

At [PatentAssist.ai](http://patentassist.ai/), we do not have automatic renewals for any of our subscription plans. Customers are required to manually renew their subscriptions, whether monthly or annually. This policy ensures that you have full control over your subscription decisions and are not automatically billed for any service.

## Cancellation Process

To cancel your annual subscription and request a refund, please contact our customer support team within the specified 45-day period. Provide your account details and the reason for cancellation so we can process your request promptly.

## Exceptions to Refund Policy

Please be aware that no refunds will be issued under any circumstances if your account is terminated, suspended, or blocked due to violations of our Terms of Service, including but not limited to activities such as phishing, impersonation, fraud, or any illegal activities.
